Subtract 1.00 from both sides: \\( 2x = 0.10 \\).\n6. Divide by 2: \\( x = 0.05 \\).\n\nThus, the ball costs $0.05.

        "reasoning_content": "We are given: \"A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?\" This is a classic puzzle. The intuitive but incorrect answer is that the ball costs $0.10. But if the ball were $0.10, then the bat costs $1.00 more, so $1.10, and then total is $1.20, not $1.10. So correct answer: ball costs $0.05, bat costs $1.05, total $1.10, and bat is $1.00 more than ball.\n\nWe need to explain step-by-step.\n\nLet's set up equations. Let b be the cost of the ball, and B be the cost of the bat. Then:\n\n(1) B + b = 1.10\n(2) B = b + 1.00\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1): (b + 1.00) + b = 1.10 => 2b + 1.00 = 1.10 => 2b = 0.10 => b = 0.05.\n\nSo ball costs $0.05.\n\nWe can explain reasoning: If the ball cost $0.10, then the bat would be $1.10, total $1.20. That's too high. So ball must be less. Alternatively, the $1.10 total includes the bat which is $1.00 more than the ball, so if we take away the $1.00 extra, we have two balls costing $0.10, so each ball is $0.05.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\nLet x be the price of the ball. Then the bat costs x + 1.00. Together they cost x + (x + 1.00) = 2x + 1.00 = 1.10. So 2x = 0.10, x = 0.05. Thus the ball costs $0.05."
